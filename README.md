# hello-world-
a repository

so i need to learn more about github. it is really confusing, but i am sure that if is tick with it, i will get used to it eventually and use it better. right now i just feel exhausted and burnt out because it is the evening. i have not worked out for the past 13 days and i cannot for the next 8 days. its really taking a toll on me. i feel so lazy and mentally exhausted. working out was the thing that kinda kept me sane. i just want this neck pain to go away man, so that i can get back to working out and feel good again. i hope it happens soon.
